# Ruby Merge Sort
Completed as part of The Odin Project: Ruby.

## Description
An implementation of the merge sort algorithm in Ruby.

## Learning objectives
- Use recursion in a real-life application
- Further understanding of the merge sort algorithm

## Merge sort
The merge sort works as follows:

1. Divide the unsorted array into two halves
2. Merge sort each half
3. Merge the sorted halves

This has an averge and worst-case performance of $O(n \log{n})$.
